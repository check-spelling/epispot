If you would like to test it out, please read Henri Froese's Medium post @ https://github.com/henrifroese/infectious_disease_modelling. The code is more or less based off of the Jupyter Notebook code listed in the post with a few twists for speed, flexibility, and accuracy. Please report an issues that you encounter with a screenshot and/or traceback in the case of an error.\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
